My dad and I are driving out to California over the course of multiple days stopping along the way to see sights and visit places. This is my first time going farther west than the Mississippi River. Driving across beautiful landscape and visiting national landmarks will be a great setup for what the rest of the summer has to offer.</p>

<p>The trip will span over about four days stopping in multiple states along the way. This will be the farthest I have ever gone by car. While it will be an experience just going out to San Francisco, it will be a long time of driving. Having someone in the car makes the trip much more bearable. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Housing Adventure!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few weeks since hearing I will be living in San Francisco for my Summer internship at Lucasfilm Studios, a group of interns and I have been rigorously been searching for housing in the nations most expensive cost of living city.

While it has not been easy, we have finally settled on a place to stay for the summer. We will be living just south of the city in a 5 bedroom 1 bath house. This will make life difficult in the morning but one of the more affordable options we had for all of us interns. </p>

<p>While the commute to work will be about 35 minutes to 45 minutes, it will be doable in a car pool between all of the interns. While we still sit out with just over a month to go until the internship starts, the thought of being on the west coast is still very exciting. Taking care of the housing has crossed off on more thing to do to prepare for the cross country trip.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Heading to California]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="ithashappened">It has Happened</h2>

<p>After years of applying to internships and getting denied or most of the time ignored, the internship of my dreams fell into my lap and I was able to get the job. Starting this summer I will be interning for Lucasfilm in San Francisco, CA as a I.T. Operations Support Intern. The offer came as a huge shock to me and I could not believe that I was selected to work in such an amazing company doing what I love.</p>

<p>Living out in California will be an amazing experience and cannot wait for. It will help me grow in my field and as a person. This really is the chance of a lifetime.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
